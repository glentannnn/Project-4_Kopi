# Project 4: Kopi App
This App is part of a deliverable for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) course, and it is my Capstone project. 

As a home barista, it is essential to track some parameters, such as grind sizes for beans, as it is dynamic and changes with time. With that in mind, I created this App, which serves as an electronic diary for baristas to track the beans they are currently using and have used before. 
The App also allows users to input their equipment as users may have multiple different equipment they use. 

## Planning for the App
### Database Design

## How to Use
### Env Variables Needed

### SQL Create Statements

## App Enhancement Roadmap
Further development are planned for the App and are listed below: 
- Include a section to mark beans as "done" when users have finished using a certain bean. This should also update the DB accordingly.
- Include proper alerts when users have input certain field incorrectly. This is to improve the user's overall experience.
- Turn this App into a social media App for users to interact with each other, and discuss certain beans and equipment they are currently using. They may also use this App to create communities for discussion on making coffee in general.
